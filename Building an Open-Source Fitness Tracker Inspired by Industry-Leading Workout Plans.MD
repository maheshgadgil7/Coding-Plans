# **Building an Open-Source Fitness Tracker Inspired by Industry-Leading Workout Plans**

The intersection of fitness and technology presents exciting opportunities for developers. Open-source projects can empower individuals to achieve their health goals by providing customizable and accessible tools. This post explores how you can create a GitHub-hosted fitness tracker inspired by transformative workout programs like [Jim Stoppani's 6-Week Shred Training](https://fitzport.com/workout-plan/jim-stoppanis-6-week-shred-training/) and [Kris Gethin's 12-Week Muscle-Building Plan](https://fitzport.com/workout-plan/12-week-muscle-building-plan-by-kris-gethin/).
